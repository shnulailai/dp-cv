if you run this code,meet such this problem:
cv2.xfeatures2d.SIFT_Create无法使用
because this version is new,try to 
reduce the version.The solution is:
1.uninstall the original version,
you could view the current of cv2 through
print(cv2.__version__) in jupyter notebook

2.and then:
(1)install opencv like this:
pip install opencv_python == 3.4.2.16
(2)install contrib package
pip install opencv_contrib_python==3.4.2.16
